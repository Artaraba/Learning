//*| Intent: This program is meant to take input from users concerning the following questions:       |*\\
//*|                1) What is the birthrate (births per hour/min/sec)?                               |*\\
//*|                 2) What is the death rate (deaths per hour/min/sec)?                             |*\\
//*|                3) What is the immigration rate (immigrations per hour/min/sec)?                  |*\\
//*|            (Default to births/deaths/immigrations per sec if no units are secified)              |*\\
//*| and produce a population growth rate projection (numbers only) number on the display screen.     |*\\
